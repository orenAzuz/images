# images

## Init client
#### To start the app you need to start the client app:
#### cd images/client/
#### npm install
#### npm start
#### (not 'ng serve' it needs to use the proxy.conf.json file.)

## DB
### MySQL server
#### need to create a user, password, and db "images" as the application.properties suggest.

## server
#### The server run is straightforward just run the main method in the ImagesApplication file.

## Task overflow
#### I use Tailwind CSS and not too much of it but it makes the client look much more elegant 
#### The images are added to the images/client/src/assets/images folder in real life we will use some storage server
#### The metadata is stored in the MySQL server
#### This is my First time using JPA I hope it is the best practice way I use it in terms of mongoOperation style

## Enjoy the cool app
